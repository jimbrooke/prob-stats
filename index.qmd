# Preface {.unnumbered}


Welcome to the course notes for Probability & Statistics. This course is delivered as part of Practical Physics for 1st year undergraduates, and comprises 10 lectures. These notes go into a little bit more depth than the lectures.  Or they will, once they are finished.

These notes borrow heavily from those written by Jonas Rademacker for his course on Mathematics for 2nd year Physics undergraduates.
